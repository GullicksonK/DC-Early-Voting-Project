# DC-Early-Voting-Project

This is a repo with DC voter data.  
It was created at DC Open Data Day 2016 to help the DC Board of Elections with the question --  we want more voters to use available early voting centers in order to  reduce the possibility of long lines at polling stations on Election Day and to maximize the investment of public dollars to run early voting centers. Using past voting patterns, can we determine where and to whom we should be promoting early voting?
